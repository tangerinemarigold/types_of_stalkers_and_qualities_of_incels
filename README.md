Depending on what you’re subjected to, it can range from annoying to terrifying to be the victim of a stalker. So what motivates a stalker? 

Stalkers are often presented in movies or television dramas as men obsessed with beautiful women, but in reality, there are different reasons why some individuals turn into stalkers. Psychiatrists and law enforcement use established categories of stalkers as a way to assess the risks they pose to their victims. Studies on the psychology of stalkers and risk factors that can lead to different outcomes have helped mental health professionals better understand stalkers, and have assisted law enforcement in figuring out how to manage them.

If you believe you’ve been the victim of a stalker, here are some of the profiles that psychiatrists have identified and documented.
Are There Different Types of Stalkers?

Studies have indicated that up to 16% of women and 7% of men are likely to be stalked in their lifetime, which is why both the federal government and all 50 states have anti-stalking laws. Those statutes refer to a pattern of behavior that one person carries out against another with the aim of harassing, intimidating, or even terrorizing their victim.

Stalking is often thought of as something done by former spouses or by someone the victim may have casually dated and broken up with. But there are also instances when people are stalked by either an acquaintance they barely know, or even a total stranger.

Some forms of stalking can include someone repeatedly showing up in places the victim frequents, showing up at their job, or sending unwanted gifts in the mail. But victims can also be stalked online. Cyberstalking is occurring more and more frequently today, as stalkers follow the victim on social media or try to embarrass or defame them online.

So why do stalkers engage in this behavior, and what sets them off? Here are the 7 types of stalkers that the healthcare industry has identified.

## Rejected Stalker

* Some stalkers have been rejected by a person they wanted a relationship with, or have just experienced a breakup. The stalker may be looking for a way to salvage their relationship, or want to remain as close to the victim as much as possible. In other instances, they’re angry and want revenge for being rejected.

* Mullen defined the rejected stalking type as an individual who has experienced the unwanted end of a close relationship, most likely with a romantic partner, but also with a parent, work associate, or acquaintance. When this stalker’s attempts to reconcile fail, they frequently seek revenge. The therapeutic focus is usually centered on the stalker "falling out of love." The individual is counseled on how to move on from an angry preoccupation with the past to the sadness of accepted loss.

## Predatory Stalker

* Predators are often sexually obsessed or have deviant sexual fantasies. Typically male, their victims are usually women who are strangers, but who the stalker has a sexual interest in. __It can start with voyeurism, which becomes a precursor to a sexual assault.__

* Finally, the predator stalker also has no desire for a relationship with their victims, but a sense of power and control. Mullen explains that they find pleasure in gathering information about their victim and fantasizing about assaulting them physically, and most frequently sexually. Predatory stalkers should almost always be managed within a sex-offender program, with the main focus being on the management of the paraphilia that is the driving force behind the stalking behavior.

## Incompetent Suitor

* These kinds of stalkers are typically incompetent at relationships, lonely, and target strangers or casual acquaintances. They assume they can convince the object of their desire to start dating them. They can often seem blind or indifferent to the suffering they inflict on the victim. Many of these stalkers have poor social skills.

* The incompetent subtype, like the intimacy seeker, hopes their behavior would lead to a close relationship, satisfying their need for contact and intimacy. However, this type of stalker acknowledges that their victim is not reciprocating their affection while they still continue their pursuit. Mullen views these stalkers as intellectually limited and socially awkward. Given their inability to comprehend and carry out socially normal and accepted courting rituals, the incompetent stalker uses methods that are often counterproductive and frightening. This was seen in 2004 when pop sensation Britney Spears’ stalker sent numerous love letters, e-mails, and photos of himself with frightening notes saying things such as “I’m chasing you.”

## Resentful Stalker

* Some people become stalkers because they feel like they’ve been mistreated in some way. These stalkers often have some form of __mental illness__, experience feelings of paranoia or persecution, and can be self-righteous and self-pitying. Stalking the victim can be a way to get revenge for their perceived mistreatment. They feel like they have a certain amount of power over the victim as they stalk them.

* The resentful stalker experiences feelings of injustice and desires revenge against their victim rather than a relationship. Their behavior reflects their perception that they have been humiliated and treated unfairly, viewing themselves as the victim. It is has been found that resentful stalkers often regard their fathers as highly controlling. Mark Chapman, the notorious John Lennon stalker and murderer is a classic case of a resentful stalker. He described himself as the world’s biggest rock fan and admired Lennon and all his work, until he read a biography of the musician. Angered that Lennon would “preach love and peace but yet have millions [of dollars],” Chapman shot and killed Lennon on December 8, 1980. In later testimonials, Chapman described how his father “never told me he loved me; and he never said he was sorry.” The focus on a distressing past and the compulsive reliving of this pain can contribute to a mood disorder. Also, in a fortunate few there is a paranoid disorder that responds at least partially, to antipsychotic medication.


## Intimacy-Seeker

* Often __mentally ill__, the intimacy-seeking stalker believes the victim will love or learn to love them, and they may have a delusional belief that the victim already does love them. In many instances, they focus on prominent or celebrity figures. 

* The intimacy seeker identifies a person, often a complete stranger, as their true love and begins to behave as if they are in a relationship with that person. Many intimacy seeking stalkers carry the delusion that their love is reciprocated. In 2009, country star Shania Twain had a stalker who fit this profile and received numerous love letters from him. He even attended Twain’s grandmother’s funeral without an invitation. The focus of management of intimacy seekers is on the underlying mental disorder coupled with efforts to overcome the social isolation and the lack of social competence that sustains it.


## Political Stalker

These stalkers are unique in that they’re motivated by political beliefs, and __end up stalking people who either agree or disagree with their views.__ 

## Hitmen

The most dangerous, victims are stalked by a hired killer who has instructions to badly injury or murder that person.

__It’s also been documented that stalkers are often unemployed or under-employed and can be delusional and have narcissistic personalities. Personality disorders are present in more than half the stalkers who have been evaluated.__

# Common thread: mental illness

* Mullen’s research suggests that professionals should focus not on the stalkers as criminals but as vulnerable, distressed individuals whose behaviors reflect, at least in part, the influence of a __serious underlying mental disorder.__ The most important step in the management of stalkers is to see them as individuals in need of psychological help.

# What are Incels
## Qualities of Incels

Source: ChatGPT-4

Social Isolation: Many self-identified incels report feeling alienated or isolated from mainstream society. This can stem from various factors such as social anxiety, depression, or difficulties in social interaction.

Sexual Frustration: The central tenet of being an incel is the inability to engage in romantic or sexual relationships, often leading to a high degree of frustration.

Resentment or Misogyny: Some incels express anger, resentment, or even hatred towards women, blaming them for their perceived rejection. It's important to note, however, that not all incels harbor these feelings.

Self-Deprecation: Incels often have low self-esteem and may use self-deprecating language. They may feel unattractive or undesirable and believe this to be the reason for their lack of romantic or sexual success.

Online Engagement: Incels are often characterized by their engagement in online communities. These forums can foster an echo chamber effect, reinforcing negative beliefs and attitudes.

Black-and-White Thinking: Some incels tend to view society, and particularly sexual and romantic relationships, in a binary, black-and-white manner, dividing men into categories such as "Chads" (attractive, successful men) and "incels" or "betas" (unsuccessful, unattractive men).

Victim Mentality: Some incels perceive themselves as victims of societal norms, particularly those related to attractiveness and romantic success. They may feel that they are unfairly disadvantaged in dating or sexual relationships.

Entitlement: Some incels may feel entitled to sexual or romantic attention, leading to frustration when these expectations are not met.

"Although mass murderers are a heterogenous group, mass murderers and incels share several characteristics, including a history of being bullied as a child, __poor self-esteem__, __perceived social rejection and isolation__, __externalization of blame__, __resentment toward others__, __antisocial__, rigid, __narcissistic__, and __grandiose personality traits__, and __revenge fantasies.__"

## No friends and loneliness
"In 2018, the moderators of incels.me (now incels.co) conducted a poll in which roughly 300 incels participated. When asked if they had friends, only one-third of the 294 respondents indicated that they did (Jeltsen, 2018). A lack of stable friendships has also been noted in the manifestos of Rodger and Chris Harper-Mercer, a lesser-known incel whose mass shooting was one of the deadliest in Oregon’s history (Flaccus, 2017; Rodger, 2014). In the opening of his manifesto, Harper-Mercer (2015) summed up his life as “one lonely enterprise… with no friends” (p. 1). Feelings of isolation resulting from a lack of friends (among other things) are common discussion topics among incels."

""It was this idea that all women were inherently manipulative. All women had an intent to exploit men."

## Incels are depressed, anxious, and paranoid individuals
"Incels often struggle with serious, unaddressed mental health conditions
A new study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine found that men who scored high on incel traits were also likely to be __depressed, anxious, and paranoid individuals.__ Moreover, the same men were found to be more likely (compared to those who scored low on incel traits) to possess a fearful attachment style. The study also found that scoring high on scales measuring paranoia, depression, and a fearful attachment style could predict the emergence of incel traits."
